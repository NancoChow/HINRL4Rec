**HINRL4Rec: a novel integrated heterogeneous network embedding with reinforcement learning for recommendation**

This is the source code of *HINRL4Rec* model which is an integrated rich-textual heterogeneous network embedding with the policy-guided path-based searching mechanism via reinforcement learning approach for explainable recommendation task.

Our works and this implemented source code are majorly inspired and inherited from previous works of Xian, Y. et al. in the proposed PGPR model <sup>[1]</sup> (https://github.com/orcax/PGPR).
